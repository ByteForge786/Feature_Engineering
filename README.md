# Feature_Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive.

Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, requires expert knowledge. "Applied machine learning" is basically feature engineering. (Andrew Ng) ... some machine learning projects succeed and some fail.

What makes the difference?

Easily the most important factor is the features used. (Pedro Domingos)

Feature Engineering: The art of coming up with new features with more predictive power using

 experience
 
 domain expertise
 
 empirical processes

Most important techniques in feature engineering:-

 Applying Domain Expertise

Combining Feature

Encoding of categorical variables

Time series feature extraction

NLP feature extraction


In this Project you will be learning a comprehensive methods to do feature engineering which is one of the most important concept.
